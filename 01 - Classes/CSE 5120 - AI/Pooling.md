### 2. Pooling

**Pooling Layer**: Pooling (also known as subsampling or downsampling) reduces the dimensionality of each feature map but retains the most important information. Pooling can be of different types, such as max pooling or average pooling.

- **Max Pooling**: Selects the maximum element from the region of the feature map covered by the filter.
- **Average Pooling**: Calculates the average of the elements in the region of the feature map covered by the filter.

Pooling helps to make the detection of features invariant to scale and orientation changes and also reduces the computational complexity for the layers that follow.
