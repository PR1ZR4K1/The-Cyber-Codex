## Computer Vision Intuition

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the real world, similar to how humans perceive and interpret images and videos.

In simpler terms, computer vision involves developing algorithms and techniques that allow computers to "see" and make sense of the visual world. This includes tasks such as:

1. **Image Recognition**: Identifying objects, patterns, or features within images.
    
2. **Object Detection**: Locating and identifying specific objects within images or video frames.
    
3. **Image Segmentation**: Dividing an image into different regions or segments to understand its structure and contents.
    
4. **Facial Recognition**: Recognizing and identifying faces in images or video.
    
5. **Motion Analysis**: Tracking and analyzing the movement of objects or people in videos.
    

Computer vision finds applications in various fields such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, medical imaging, surveillance, augmented reality, and more. It enables machines to perceive and understand visual information, allowing them to interact with the world in a more intelligent and human-like manner.
