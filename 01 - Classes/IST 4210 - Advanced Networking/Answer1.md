# IST 5150

1.) Suppose you are the project manager for the following project.

Original Schedule:

- Task 1: 1 day
- Task 2: 3 days (depends on 1)
- Task 3: 2 days (depends on 1) - finished 1 day early, so took 1 day
- Task 4: 3 days (depends on 2) - now needs 6 days
- Task 5: 5 days (depends on 3)
- Task 6: 1 day (depends on 4,5)

1a.) Impact Analysis:

1. Task 3 finished early (saved 1 day)
    - This allows Task 5 to start earlier
2. Task 4 duration increased by 3 days
    - Original: 3 days → New: 6 days
    - Since Task 4 depends on Task 2, this delay will push back Task 6
    - The early finish of Task 3 doesn't help with Task 4's delay since Task 4 depends on Task 2

Effects:

1. Project completion will be delayed by 3 days because:
    - The 3-day increase in Task 4 will directly push Task 6 later
    - The early finish of Task 3 helps Task 5 start earlier but doesn't affect the critical path through Task 4
2. Resource utilization may need to be adjusted
3. Project costs likely to increase due to longer duration

1b)  What would have happened if you had not been monitoring the status of the project?:

1. Would not have detected Task 4's need for extended duration until too late
2. Might have missed the opportunity to take advantage of Task 3's early completion
3. Could have led to:
    - Unexpected delays
    - Resource conflicts
    - Budget overruns
    - Stakeholder dissatisfaction
    - Potential domino effect on dependent tasks or projects
    - Missed opportunity to mitigate the impact through early intervention
