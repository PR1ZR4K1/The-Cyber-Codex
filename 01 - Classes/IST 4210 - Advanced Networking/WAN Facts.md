# WAN Facts

A private wide area network (WAN) connects different sites using communication methods that maintain the privacy of the data being transferred. Customers send data from one site to another through the WAN knowing that any other private WAN customers will not be able to see those transmissions. A public WAN uses a public network to connect various sites.

This lesson covers the following topics:

- Private WAN vs. public WAN
- WAN connectivity types

## Private WAN vs. Public WAN

WANs are typically implemented as either a private WAN or a public WAN. The following table distinguishes the two:

|WAN Type|Description|
|---|---|
|Private|A private WAN allows a site to connect to one or more designated sites using communication methods that maintain the privacy of the data being transferred. Private WANs typically use the following types of WAN technologies to connect sites:<br><br>- Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)<br>- Leased lines<br>- Ethernet WANs<br>- Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)<br>- Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT)|
|Public|A public WAN (e.g., the internet) allows access to any number of sites outside the private network. The communication lines are not protected and the entity initiating the communication is responsible for the security of the data. Public WAN connections can include:<br><br>- Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) which uses the internet<br>- ISDN which uses the internet<br>- Cellular<br>- DSL<br>- Cable internet|

## WAN Connectivity Types

The following table describes the commonly used WAN connectivity service types:

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|Cellular|Cellular networking uses a digital mobile phone network for internet access. Two main communication technologies are used with mobile networks:<br><br>- Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) was created in Europe and is used by the majority of the world's mobile service providers. GSM uses time-division multiple access (TDMA) technology to allow multiple connections on the same frequency.<br>- Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is used by the majority of mobile service providers within the United States. It enables multiple connections on the same frequency. With CDMA, each call is encoded with a unique key and then transmitted simultaneously. The unique keys are then used to extract each call from the transmission.<br><br>Many mobile devices, like smart phones and tablets, can be purchased with mobile data technology integrated. A cellular adapter can be installed on a notebook computer to enable cellular internet access. Cellular networking is a truly mobile solution; the mobile device can be in motion and still have internet access. The user does not have to manually reconnect the device as it moves from cell tower to cell tower. However, the faster the device is moving, the less bandwidth is available.<br><br>Cellular internet access is limited to areas with cell service coverage. Coverage is dictated by the provider's network. Some areas will have weak coverage or no coverage at all.<br><br>Cellular networks used for voice and data include the following types:<br><br>- 2G (second generation) networks were the first to offer digital data services. 2G data speeds are slow (14.4 Kbps) and are used mainly for text messaging, not internet connectivity. 2.5G supports speeds up to 144 Kbps.<br>- EDGE (also called 2.75G) networks are an intermediary between 2G and 3G networks. EDGE is the first cellular technology to be truly internet compatible, with speeds of 400–1,000 Kbps.<br>- 3G offers simultaneous voice and data. Minimum speeds for stationary users are quoted at 2 Mbps or higher. The following extensions enhance 3G networks:<br><br>- HSPA+, also known as _smart antenna,_ uses multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO). HSPA+ significantly increases data throughput and link range without additional bandwidth or increased transmit power.<br>- Long Term Evolution (LTE) and LTE-Advanced increase downlink/uplink speeds to 100/50 Mbps and 1Gbps/500Mbps, respectively.<br><br>- 4G is available with minimum speeds around 3–8 Mbps, with over 100 Mbps possible. 4G:<br><br>- Uses MIMO.<br>- Is not compatible with 3G. 4G requires a complete retrofit by service providers and new equipment for the consumer.<br>- Utilizes Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX). WiMAX delivers high-speed internet service (up to 1 Gbps for stationary users) to large geographical areas.<br><br>- 5G is available and coverage is expanding. If offers speeds up to 10Gbps. 5G:<br><br>- Ensures low latency: from 200ms with 4G to 1ms in 5G. The low latency enables immersive Virtual Reality (VR) gaming, remote surgical operations, vehicle to vehicle communications including autonomous cars, and much more.<br>- Is not compatible with 3G or 4G, but some deployments are compatible with 4G LTE; 5G requires a complete retrofit by service providers and new equipment for the consumer.<br>- Allows more devices connected than 4G, 1 million devices per 1 Km2, or .386 square miles.<br>- Enables low power consumption allowing objects to operate for months or even years without the need for human assistance.<br>- Promises ubiquitous connectivity for the Internet of Things (IoT) and provision for densely populated areas, such as stadiums, smart cities, office towers, convention centers, and more.|
|Metro Ethernet|Metro Ethernet, sometimes called a _metropolitan area network_ (MAN), is an Ethernet network that covers an area as small as a few city blocks to as large as an entire metropolitan city. MANs provide a connection to the internet as well as connections to remote locations within the MAN. Most MANs are owned and managed by a city and provided as a public utility. Many IT professionals do not differentiate between a wide area network and a MAN since they use essentially the same network technologies.|
|Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)|DSL offers digital communications over what is referred to as plain old telephone service (POTS) lines.<br><br>- Data is sent in multiple channels over existing wiring.<br>- Configuration requires a DSL router (or a cable modem) or NIC, attached with USB or Ethernet to the phone line.<br>- DSL is not available everywhere; the location must be within a fixed distance of network switching equipment.<br><br>There are multiple variations of DSL (collectively referred to as xDSL). Variations included:<br><br>- Asymmetrical DSL (ADSL) provides different download and upload speeds.<br><br>- Speeds are up to 12 Mbps downstream and 1—3.5 Mbps upstream. Newer ADSL2+ provides up to 24 Mbps downstream.<br>- ADSL allows regular analog dial-up and digital access on the same line at the same time. Splitters are required to keep the analog signals from interfering with the digital signals.<br>- ADSL is good for internet access (browsing), but is not well suited for internet services, such as maintaining your own website.<br><br>- Symmetrical DSL (SDSL) provides equal download and upload speeds.<br><br>- Depending on the region, speeds are between 1.544—2.048 Mbps. Newer SHDSL provides between 4.6—5.696 Mbps.<br>- The entire line is used for data; simultaneous voice and data is not supported. Splitters are not required because voice traffic does not exist on the line.<br><br>- Very high DSL (VDSL or VHDSL) is similar to asymmetrical DSL, with higher speeds.<br><br>- Speeds can be up to 52 Mbps downstream and 12—16 Mbps upstream, depending on the distance. Newer VDSL2 provides up to 100 Mbps at a distance of 300 meters.<br>- Both voice and digital data is supported on the same line at the same time; splitters are required.<br><br>PPPoE allows point-to-point connections over DSL using an Ethernet link. PPPoE:<br><br>- Creates a tunnel between the customer router and the ISP router.<br>- Encapsulates frames into a tunnel header.<br>- Allows ISPs to authenticate the user.<br>- Uses a virtual dialer interface on which PPPoE is configured.<br>- Links the Ethernet interface to the dialer interface.|
|Cable|Cable internet access is typically offered by companies that provide cable television access. Existing cable TV lines provide bandwidth for internet access in addition to cable TV stations.<br><br>- Cable internet uses a cable modem to convert analog signals over multiple channels.<br>- Typical cable internet download speeds are 100-250 Mbps with upload speeds of 5-35 Mbps. Some providers offer both upload and download speeds of 2000 Mbps at a significantly higher cost.<br>- Bandwidth is shared between users within the same area (neighborhood). Consequently, actual speeds may be considerably less than the advertised speed.<br>- Many cable providers prevent connections from more than one host to the network.|
|ISDN|ISDN offers digital communications over either existing POTS or T1 lines.<br><br>- ISDN is more common in Europe than in the United States.<br>- The transmission medium is divided into channels for digital data.<br>- Subscribers must be within a certain distance of the phone company equipment, although this distance can be extended with repeaters.<br>- Phone calls use digital ISDN phones or analog phones connected to a converter.<br><br>There are two main implementations of ISDN:<br><br>- ISDN BRI (basic rate interface) provides two 64-Kbps channels for data and one 16-Kbps control channel. These are called B (bearer) channels. BRI uses 4 wires on the existing POTS installation. With ISDN BRI, you can use one channel for voice and one channel for data, or both channels for different voice calls. Depending on the implementation, you can also bond both B channels to use them together for faster data speeds.<br>- ISDN PRI (primary rate) provides twenty-three 64-Kbps data channels and one 64-Kbps control channel on a T1 line (or 30 data channels on an E1 line).|
|VSAT|Be familiar with the following VSAT facts.<br><br>- A satellite-based WAN connection can be established using VSAT satellite links in locations where wired WAN service isn't available due to location or physical geography.<br>- VSAT uses satellite dishes, radio signals, and satellites to provide wireless WAN connectivity.<br>- A small satellite dish (about 1m in diameter) is used to communicate with the service provider's satellite in geosynchronous orbit above the earth.<br>- A VSAT implementation consists of the following components:<br><br>- Antenna.<br>- Block Upconverter (BUC) for transmitting data.<br>- Low-noise Block Downconverter (LNB) for receiving data.<br>- Orthomode transducer (OMT) for combining and/or separating two microwave signals.<br>- Interfacility link cable (IFL).<br>- Indoor unit (IDU) for providing an interface to the organization's network using two physical connections:<br><br>- One Ethernet port that provides an interface for the organization's internal router.<br>- Two F-type connectors that connect to the BUC and the LNB on the dish.<br><br>Due to the transmission distances involved, VSAT connections usually experience high levels of latency when compared to wired WAN solutions.|
|MPLS|MPLS is a high-performance method for forwarding packets through a network. MPLS reduces the number of routing lookups by using labels and label switching to forward packets. Packets are forwarded based on the contents of the label, without examination of the packet. This allows the creation of end-to-end circuits across any type of WAN transport medium, using any protocol.<br><br>MPLS eliminates dependence on a particular Data Link layer technology. MPLS combines the advantages of Data Link layer switching with Network layer routing to increase performance, traffic management, scalability, and flexibility. Key facts about MPLS include the following:<br><br>- MPLS allows routers at the edge of a network to apply or impose simple labels to packets.<br>- MPLS-enabled routers switch packets based on the label information, not on packet contents.<br>- Packets are routed with a minimal amount of routing lookup overhead.<br>- MPLS eliminates the need to run a particular routing protocol on all devices.<br>- MPLS is designed to support forwarding of protocols other than TCP/IP and can carry ATM, SONET, and Ethernet traffic.<br>- Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) is required for all MPLS-enabled Cisco routers.|
