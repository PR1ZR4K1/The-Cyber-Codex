# Answer 21


Given:
- Probability of Poor Economy = 0.6
- Therefore, Probability of Good Economy = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4

1. EMV Calculation for Expensive Complex ERP:
- Poor Economy Contribution = $-7M × 0.6 = $-4.2M
- Good Economy Contribution = $36M × 0.4 = $14.4M
- EMV = $-4.2M + $14.4M = $10.2M

2. EMV Calculation for Affordable Simple ERP:
- Poor Economy Contribution = $4M × 0.6 = $2.4M
- Good Economy Contribution = $9M × 0.4 = $3.6M
- EMV = $2.4M + $3.6M = $6M

Decision Tree:
```
                           [Poor Economy (0.6) → $-7M
Expensive Complex ERP ―――┤
                           [Good Economy (0.4) → $36M
                           EMV = $10.2M

                           [Poor Economy (0.6) → $4M
Affordable Simple ERP ―――┤
                           [Good Economy (0.4) → $9M
                           EMV = $6M
```

Decision:
- The Expensive Complex ERP system should be selected because it has a higher EMV ($10.2M vs $6M)
- While this option carries more risk (potential loss in poor economy), the higher potential gain in a good economy makes it the better choice based on EMV analysis
- This assumes the company is willing to accept the risk of losing $7M in a poor economy scenario

The Expensive Complex ERP system provides the best expected value despite having higher risk.
