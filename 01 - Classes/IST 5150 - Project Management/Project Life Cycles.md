# Project Life Cycles


### Types

**Predictive Life Cycle**: is characterized as a sequential process (sometimes referred to as waterfall)

**Iterative Life Cycle**: Life cycle that allows for the use of prototypes to gain feedback

**Incremental Life Cycle**: Life cycle that focuses on speed of delivery by providing parts of the overall product as they are completed

**Agile Life Cycle**: Combines benefits of iterative and incremental life cycles by obtaining rapid feedback and allowing for quickly delivering subsets of the final product

## Project Management Processes

**Planning, Executing, and Monitoring/Controlling are the most content filled processes.**

*Process groups overlap a lot and that is fine*

### Initiating

- Define what project is.
- Develop project charter
- Define project stakeholder (who is being influenced)

### Planning

- establish scope of project
- project management plan
- collect requirement
- define activities
- define sequence of activities

### Executing

- process needed to be completed
- manage project knowledge
- manage quality
- acquire resources we need

### Monitoring and Controlling

- Track review and regulate progress of project
- validating scope 
- monitor risk of project

### Closing

- processes needed to perform to close project
- least number of processes


## Organization Structure

### Functional

![[Pasted image 20240913182104.png]]

*Staff of each functional group work separately*

No collaboration between the groups.

### Project-Oriented

![[Pasted image 20240913182539.png]]

*Each team has people with different backgrounds/expertise*

Contrasts with functional where members for each group all specialize in a topic

### Matrix

![[Pasted image 20240913182432.png]]

*Combination of the two previous*

- We have functional groups
- We have project managers
- staff has their own functional manager and project manager

**Strong matrix**

- more similar to project-oriented

**Weak matrix**

- more similar to functional

**Balanced matrix**

- mix of both strong and weak
