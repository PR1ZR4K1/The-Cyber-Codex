# How popular culture ALSO relates to democracy

The following discusses the role of media, specifically entertainment media like sitcoms, dramas, reality TV, and sports, in a democratic society. It presents two contrasting viewpoints from media scholars:

## *Pop Culture as a Distraction:*

The first perspective argues that popular culture serves as a distraction from more important civic issues. This view is deeply informed by Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World," where people are controlled by pleasure and distraction. Neil Postman also explores this idea in his book "Amusing Ourselves to Death," suggesting that the excess of entertainment may have serious consequences for democracy, drowning meaningful discourse in trivialities.
## *Pop Culture as a Distraction:*

The second perspective argues that popular culture is an essential part of democratic society. It highlights the importance of representation, not just in politics but also in media. The media should depict the diversity of experiences and communities in society. The text suggests that being represented in popular culture can help marginalized communities feel like important members of society and may also shape social and political realities.

## Things to Consider

The text encourages the reader to examine their own media consumption habits and to consider the balance of "substantive" and "trivial" content. It also hints that the next module will explore the effectiveness of U.S. popular culture in depicting the diversity of people's experiences, particularly those of marginalized communities.
