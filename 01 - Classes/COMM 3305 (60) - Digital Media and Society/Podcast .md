# Podcast - Is Washington Finally Ready to Take On Big Tech?

## Lina Kahn

Law student in her 20s that made a very prominent paper arguing that big companies may be breaching the Federal Trade Commission's Anti-Trust Laws. Basically the main delimiter for whether or not a company is adhering to these laws is whether or not consumers are happy and that prices are not soaring. Since these companies are so massive they can have very low prices which makes it super hard for any other company to compete which she argues is an issue. Her proposal is that regulations need to be adjusted so that small start ups can have a chance in the current economy.

### Biden Administration 

The Biden administration appoints her as chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). 

#### Case against Facebook 

Lina tried to act against Facebook/Metaverse's attempt to buy out a small start up company, but she fails.
