# Freedom of the Press Summary

The founding fathers, particularly Madison and Jefferson, thought an informed public was key to a well-functioning democracy. So, they didn't just say "freedom of the press is a thing"; they actively helped it thrive by offering financial assistance, like subsidized postal rates for newspaper distribution.

## Madison Perspective

Madison is basically saying, "Look, if you want the people to rule themselves, you've got to keep them in the know." If not, you'll either end up with a sham democracy controlled by a few smart folks, or even worse, you could have the public electing someone dangerous, just because they didn't know better.

## Jefferson Perspective

Jefferson takes it a step further. He’s like, "It’s better to have a society with newspapers but without a government than the other way around." He argues that the public is the ultimate check on the government, and they can only do this well if they're well-informed.

## Aligned Perspectives

They didn't think a self-governing society could survive or thrive if its citizens weren't informed. So, they enshrined freedom of speech and of the press in the First Amendment, and they <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">subsidized</mark> the early press to ensure the public had newspapers and pamphlets to read.

### Subsidies for Newspapers 

These guys took their belief so far that they implemented subsidies for newspapers. We're talking big bucks—if those subsidies were in today's money, it'd be somewhere around $30-35 billion a year. Yet, these subsidies were designed to be content-neutral to ensure that the press remains free and independent. In other words, no playing favorites based on what's being published.

### Things to Consider

- Do you think it's cool for the government to financially back newspapers? 
- Does that jive with your idea of a 'free press,' or does it muddy the waters?
