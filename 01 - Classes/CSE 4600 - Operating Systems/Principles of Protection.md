# Principles of Protection


## Rough-Grained Privilege Management

Easier, simpler, but least privilege now done in large chunks

ex. traditional Unix processes -> either associated user, or root

## Fine-Grained Management

More complex, more overhead, but more protective 

ex. file ACL lists, RBAC

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Audit Trail</mark> - recording all protection-orientated activities, important to understanding what happened, why, and catching things that shouldn't 

Capability List is referring to the operations that can be performed on each domain. Domain can be user, program, or system

Access Control List refers to the operations that can be performed on each object. Objects can be files or device ie. printer or scanner
