# POSIX API

POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is a family of standards specified by the IEEE for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. POSIX defines the application programming interface (API), along with command line shells and utility interfaces, for software compatibility with variants of Unix and other operating systems.

The POSIX API includes definitions for a wide variety of operations, such as:

1. **File and Directory Operations**: POSIX defines how files and directories are handled, manipulated, and accessed.
    
2. **Process Control**: POSIX includes API calls for creating, executing, and managing processes in a system.
    
3. **Threading and Concurrency**: POSIX includes a set of threading and concurrency functions for managing multi-threaded applications.
    
4. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: POSIX defines several forms of IPC, including message queues, semaphores, and shared memory.
    
5. **Input/Output (I/O)**: POSIX specifies how I/O operations should be handled, including reading from and writing to files and devices.
    
6. **Signals**: POSIX specifies how signals are used in a system, which are a form of software interrupt.
    
7. **Time and Timer APIs**: POSIX defines functions for handling and formatting time, setting alarms, and timers.
    
8. **Networking**: POSIX provides basic networking API calls, though much of the detailed networking functionality is provided through additional libraries like Berkeley sockets.
    

## Why is POSIX API sought after?

1. **Portability**: Applications written using POSIX API can be ported to any operating system that conforms to the POSIX standard, facilitating cross-platform development.
    
2. **Uniformity**: POSIX provides a consistent and uniform set of interfaces, making it easier for developers to write applications without worrying about OS-specific quirks.
    
3. **Vendor Neutrality**: Since POSIX is an open standard, it doesn’t tie developers to a specific vendor’s operating system or technology, thereby avoiding vendor lock-in.
    
4. **Rich Ecosystem**: Many tools, libraries, and utilities have been developed around POSIX, offering a rich ecosystem for developers.
    
5. **Maturity and Reliability**: POSIX has been around for several decades and is a proven technology, used in many critical and reliable systems.
    
6. **Skills Transfer**: Learning the POSIX API enables developers to work with a variety of operating systems and environments, making their skills more versatile and transferable.
    
7. **Compatibility**: Many modern operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and various BSDs, are POSIX compliant or largely compatible, making the POSIX API relevant and widely applicable.
