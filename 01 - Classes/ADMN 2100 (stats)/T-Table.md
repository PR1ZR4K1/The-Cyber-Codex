# T-Table

Similar to the z-table, but we use it for a t-distribution which is created for a sample instead of a population which has a normal distribution

## One-Tailed t-Test

What is the t-critical value for a one-tailed alpha level of 0.05 with 12 degrees of freedom?

- 1.782

## Two-Tailed t-Test

You have a sample size of 30. What are the t-critical values for a two-tailed test with a=0.05?

*In this case you find degrees of freedom which is n-1 (29) depending on the alpha value and the number of tails you can find the tail probability p $a/$num_tails $(0.05/2) = 0.025$*

Finally plot this on the t-table:

- 2.045

## Bounds of Area

Question:

![[Pasted image 20240329154331.png]]

- DF: 24 - 1 = 23
- t-stat: 2.45

Using these values you go into the table starting at the row where df is 23 and going until you find values close to 2.45. Next, you find the range of p values that will contain 2.45 and that will be the answer:

- 0.02 $\rightarrow$ 0.01
