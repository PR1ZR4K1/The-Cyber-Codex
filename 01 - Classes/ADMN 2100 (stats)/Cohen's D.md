## Cohen's d Overview

### Introduction

- **Cohen's d** is a measure of effect size used in statistics to quantify the difference between two means.
- Introduced by **Jacob Cohen**.

### Calculation

- **Expression**:
    
    $$d = \frac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{s}$$
    
    where:
    - $(\bar{X}_1)$ and $(\bar{X}_2)$ are the means of the two groups.
    - `s` is the pooled standard deviation.

### Interpretation of Values

- **Small Effect**: `d = 0.2`
- **Medium Effect**: `d = 0.5`
- **Large Effect**: `d = 0.8`
- These thresholds help to interpret the practical significance of differences observed.

### Uses

- **Comparative Studies**: Commonly used in research to compare differences in interventions, treatments, or conditions.
- **Meta-Analysis**: Useful in synthesizing findings across multiple studies, providing a standardized measure of effect.

### Advantages

- **Standardized**: Makes it easier to compare results across studies with different scales or units.
- **Simplicity**: Simple to calculate and interpret, making it accessible for researchers from various fields.

### Limitations

- **Sensitivity to Sample Size**: Like many statistical measures, Cohen's d can be influenced by sample size, affecting its stability.
- **Assumption of Normality**: Assumes that the data distributions are reasonably normal.
