## Example Scenario for Computing the Line of Best Fit Using Linear Regression

### Scenario Description
Imagine a small business owner who operates an online apparel store wants to predict future sales based on advertising spend. The hypothesis is that there is a linear relationship between the amount of money spent on advertising (independent variable) and the revenue generated from sales (dependent variable).

### Data Collection
- **Data Points**: The owner collects monthly data over the past year (12 months).
- **Variables**:
  - Independent Variable $(X)$: Advertising spend (in dollars).
  - Dependent Variable $(Y)$: Sales revenue (in dollars).

### Data Preparation
- The data is reviewed to ensure there are no missing values or anomalies. 
- All figures are confirmed to be in dollars, and no normalization is required as both variables share the same scale.

### Model Definition
- The linear regression model is defined as:
$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \epsilon
$$
where:
  - $(y)$ represents the sales revenue,
  - $(x)$ represents the advertising spend,
  - $(\beta_0)$ is the intercept,
  - $(\beta_1)$ is the slope, indicating the change in sales revenue for each dollar spent on advertising,
  - $(\epsilon)$ is the error term, capturing the deviation of predicted values from actual values.

### Computation of Coefficients
- Assume the necessary summations and mean calculations have been performed:
  - $(\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y}))$
  - $(\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2)$
- The slope $(\beta_1)$ and intercept $(\beta_0)$ are computed using the formulas:
$$
\beta_1 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2}
$$
$$
\beta_0 = \bar{y} - \beta_1\bar{x}
$$


### Computing the Intercept $(\beta_0)$

- Given the computed slope $(\beta_1)$ and the means of the independent variable $(\bar{x})$ and the dependent variable $(\bar{y})$, the intercept can be calculated as: $$ \beta_0 = \bar{y} - \beta_1\bar{x} $$
- This step calculates the point at which the regression line crosses the y-axis by adjusting for the average effect of $(x)$ on $(y)$ based on the slope.

### Model Fitting
- With $(\beta_1)$ and $(\beta_0)$ computed, the line of best fit is established. This line can now be used to predict future sales based on planned advertising expenditures.

### Model Validation
- The fit of the model is evaluated using R-squared, which measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.
- Residual analysis is conducted to ensure that the assumptions of linearity, independence, equal variance, and normality are met.

### Conclusion
This example illustrates how linear regression can be applied in a business context to make informed decisions. By understanding the relationship between advertising spend and sales, the business owner can better allocate the advertising budget to maximize revenue.
