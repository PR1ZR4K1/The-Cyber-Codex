## Calculating the Z-Score

The z-score, also known as a standard score, quantifies how many standard deviations an individual data point is from the mean of the dataset. It is a measure of relative position of the data point within the dataset.

### Formula

The z-score is calculated using the formula:

$$
z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

- $z$ is the z-score.
- $x$ is the value of the data point.
- $\mu$ is the mean of the dataset.
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the dataset.

### For a Sample

When calculating z-scores for data from a sample, the formula adjusts to use the sample mean ($\bar{x}$) and sample standard deviation ($s$) instead:

$$
z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{s}
$$
### Z-Score for a Sampling Distribution

When working with sampling distributions, the z-score formula is adapted to reflect the distribution of sample means rather than individual data points. This is crucial in hypothesis testing or constructing confidence intervals for the population mean when the population standard deviation is known.

#### Formula

The z-score for the sample mean in the context of a sampling distribution is given by:

$$
z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}
$$

- $z$ is the z-score for the sample mean.
- $\bar{x}$ is the mean of the sample.
- $\mu$ is the mean of the population.
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the population.
- $n$ is the size of the sample.
- $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$ represents the standard error of the mean, adjusting the population standard deviation to account for the sample size.

#### Interpretation

This formula is used to determine how many standard errors the sample mean is from the population mean. It helps in assessing the likelihood of observing a sample mean given the population parameters, which is fundamental in statistical inference.

- A **high absolute z-score** (far from 0) indicates that the sample mean is unusually far from the population mean, considering the expected variability in sample means.
- A **z-score close to 0** suggests that the sample mean is close to what we would expect, given the variability among sample means.

#### Usage

- **Hypothesis Testing**: To assess whether a sample mean significantly differs from a hypothesized population mean.
- **Confidence Intervals**: To calculate the range of values within which we are certain the population mean lies, based on the sample mean.

This adapted z-score formula takes into account the central limit theorem, which states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will be normally distributed, or very close to it, regardless of the shape of the population distribution, provided the sample size is sufficiently large (usually $(n \geq 30)$).



### Steps to Calculate the Z-Score

1. **Determine the Mean ($\mu$ or $\bar{x}$)**: Calculate the average of all data points.
2. **Calculate the Standard Deviation ($\sigma$ or $s$)**: Use the appropriate formula for population or sample standard deviation.
3. **Compute the Z-Score for Each Data Point**: Subtract the mean from the data point ($x - \mu$ or $x - \bar{x}$) and divide the result by the standard deviation ($\sigma$ or $s$).

### Interpretation

- A **positive z-score** indicates that the data point is above the mean.
- A **negative z-score** suggests that the data point is below the mean.
- A z-score of **0** means the data point is exactly at the mean.
- The magnitude of the z-score tells how far and in what direction the data point deviates from the mean, in terms of standard deviations.

### Usage

Z-scores are used in various statistical analyses, including standardization of scores for comparison and identification of outliers. They are also foundational in calculating probabilities for normal distributions.
