# Intro to Statistical Research Methods

Lessons 2 and 3 from Udacity's Statistics Course

## Causal Inference

*Show Relationships* => Observational studies and surveys

*Show Causation* => Controlled experiment

### Benefits of Surveys

- Easy way to get information on a population
- Relatively inexpensive
- Conducted remotely
- Anyone can access and analyze survey results

### Downsides of Surveys

- Untruthful responses
- Biased responses
- Respondents not understanding the questions
- Respondents refusing to answer

## Key Terms

- *Sample* refers to a smaller group selected from the population for the purpose of conducting a study.
- *Statistic* is a numerical characteristic of a sample, such as a sample mean or sample proportion.
- *Parameter* is a numerical characteristic of a population, such as a population mean or population proportion.
- *Population* refers to the complete set of items or individuals that you are interested in studying
- *Construct* is an abstract concept that is specifically chosen or created to explain a given phenomenon, behavior, or event. They are not directly observable or measurable, but they are used to understand and assess psychological traits, attitudes, or theoretical concepts.
- *Operational Definition* is a clear, precise, and measurable definition of a variable or a concept (often a construct) being studied.
- *Extraneous Variables* are variables that are not the focus of a study but can affect the outcome of the research if not controlled.
- *Convenience Sample* a non-probabilistic sampling method where participants or data points are selected based on their availability and ease of access rather than using a random or systematic method.
- *Random Sample* a probabilistic sampling method where each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for the study
- *Probabilistic Sampling Method* every member of the population has a known and non-zero probability of being selected, relies on random selection
- *Non-Probabilistic Sampling Method* the selection of participants is not random, and not every member of the population has a chance of being included.
