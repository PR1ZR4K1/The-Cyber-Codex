# z-score Examples

#### Calculate z-score given this situation:

**Use the formula for calculating z-score for a sample mean**

$$
z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}
$$

#### Plug in the values:

$$
z = \frac{8.3 - 7.47}{2.41/\sqrt{50}}
$$
$z = 2.4353$

#### Do we reject the null or fail to reject the null?

**z-score falls within one of the critical regions**

We reject the null.

#### Question

What is the probability of randomly selecting a sample of size 50 with a mean of at least 8.3 from this population?

**using the z-score we can find the probability within the z-table**

Using $z=2.44$ we get a value from the table:

- 0.9927
- This covers the area to the left of where our z-score is located so to answer the question we subtract 1 from it
- $1-0.9927 = 0.0073$
