### Types of Designs for Dependent t-tests

#### Repeated Measures Design
- **Description**: In this design, participants are measured multiple times under different conditions. This is common in studies where the interest is in observing the effect of different conditions over time on the same subjects.
- **Application**: Useful for studies assessing changes due to interventions or over time, such as cognitive tests before and after training.

#### Longitudinal Design
- **Description**: This design involves repeated observations of the same variables (e.g., behaviors, conditions) over long periods. Unlike the general repeated measures design, longitudinal studies are specifically interested in tracking changes over a significant duration.
- **Application**: Often used in developmental psychology, aging research, and any field where changes over time are the focus, such as the progression of diseases or the long-term effects of a medical treatment.

#### Pretest-Posttest Design
- **Description**: Participants are tested on a specific measure before and after an intervention to directly assess the effect of the intervention.
- **Application**: Commonly used in educational research to evaluate the impact of teaching methods or in clinical settings to assess treatment effects. This design is valuable for demonstrating cause-and-effect relationships.
