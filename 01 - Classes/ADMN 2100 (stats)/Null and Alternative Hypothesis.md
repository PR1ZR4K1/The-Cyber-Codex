### Hypotheses Explained

- $H_0$ (null hypothesis): It states that there is no effect or difference, or more specifically, that the population mean $(\mu)$ is equal to a hypothesized value $(\mu_0​)$. The null hypothesis is what you assume to be true before collecting any data, and it's typically the hypothesis that you are testing against.
    
- $H_a$​ (alternative hypothesis): It represents what you want to prove or suspect might be true instead of $H_0$​. It is a statement that there is some effect or difference, that the population mean $(\mu)$ is not equal to the hypothesized value $(\mu_0​)$. The alternative hypothesis can be one-sided (less than, $\mu \lt \mu_0$​, or greater than, $\mu \gt \mu_0$​) or two-sided (not equal to, $\mu \ne \mu_0$​).
    

In a t-test, you compare your sample data to the null hypothesis and use the t-statistic to decide whether the evidence is strong enough to reject $H_0$​ in favor of $H_a$​. The decision is typically based on the p-value and the chosen significance level (commonly 0.05).
