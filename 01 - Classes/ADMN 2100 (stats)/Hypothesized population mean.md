# Hypothesized population mean

The hypothesized population mean, often denoted as $(\mu_0)$​, is a specific value of the mean that you propose or expect based on the null hypothesis in statistical testing. It's essentially the average you think your data will have before you collect and analyze any of the data. This value is what you compare your sample's mean against to see if there's a significant difference or if any observed difference is likely due to chance. So, if you're testing whether a new diet changes average weight, $(\mu_0)$​ might be the current average weight before starting the diet, serving as a benchmark for comparison.
