# 20th century Intro

1. **Impressionism**: Originally a painting style from mid-to-late 19th century France, characterized by small brushstrokes and unblended color to capture the impression of light. This style influenced music, leading to compositions that gave impressions of scenes, objects, or emotions, breaking away from traditional structures of melody and harmony.
    
2. **Expressionism**: Arising mainly in Germany and Austria, this movement was influenced by modern art and the social upheavals of the time, including World War I. Expressionism in music and art reflected intense emotions and inner turmoil, using dissonant, chaotic, and distorted elements. This period also coincided with significant social changes and movements in the United States.
    
3. **Modernism**: A broad movement across various arts including literature, visual arts, architecture, dance, and music, Modernism represented a departure from past styles. It was marked by experimentation and the creation of new forms of expression, particularly after World War I.

# 20th Century Music

This text delves into the artistic movements of Impressionism, Expressionism, and Modernism, particularly in the context of music, and explains their characteristics and influences.

1. **Impressionism in Music**: This section describes Impressionism as a movement focusing on mood and atmosphere rather than concrete depiction. It borrows philosophically and aesthetically from the late 19th-century French painting style. In music, Impressionism, exemplified by composers like Claude Debussy, aims to evoke moods and scenes through innovative musical sounds, departing from traditional composition methods.
    
2. **Expressionism**: Starting with a reference to Edvard Munch’s painting "The Scream", this section outlines Expressionism’s impact on music. The movement is characterized by conveying subjective feelings and exploring the unconscious. In musical terms, it often employs dissonance to evoke emotions like anxiety, anger, or despair. Expressionist music is described as having extreme contrasts, distorted melodies, and a focus on evoking unsettling emotions. The influence of Expressionist music is noted in modern genres like heavy metal and progressive rock.
    
3. **Musical Terms - Dissonance and Consonance**: The text explains dissonance as music that sounds strange or unsettling, using contrasting pitches to create an unusual sound. In contrast, consonance is described as music that sounds pleasant and appealing.
    
4. **Modernism**: Finally, the text discusses Modernism in music, which emerged around the turn of the 20th century and was marked by innovation and experimentation. Modernist music challenged traditional music structures, including harmony, melody, and rhythm, aligning with broader Modernism in the arts. Composers like Igor Stravinsky are mentioned as pivotal figures in this movement, pushing the boundaries of classical music.
