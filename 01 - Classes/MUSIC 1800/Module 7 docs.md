# American Classical INTRO

The 20th century saw American composers striving to create a musical style that would distinctly represent and define American generations. They sought to incorporate traditional musical elements into American culture with new forms of expression, leading to a unique identity for American Classical music.

A significant factor in the proliferation and diversification of American music was the advent of radio and recorded music in the early 1920s. This technology made music more accessible to the general public, allowing people to enjoy music at home and leading to the rise of popular music targeting various demographics. Radio, recording, and movies helped musicians and entertainers become national icons, embedding music deeply into American culture.

The text concludes by mentioning pioneers of the early American Classical music, such as Charles Ives, Aaron Copland, Samuel Barber, and John Adams, and then transitions to discussing mid-century forms like Minimalism and Aleatoric (Chance) music, pioneered by Phillip Glass, Steve Reich, and John Cage. This module aims to explore these developments in American Classical music.

# American Classical Music

1. **European Model and Orchestras**: Initially, American classical music mirrored the European model. Major cities like New York, Boston, and Chicago established orchestras financed by wealthy patrons. These orchestras aimed to perform European Baroque, Classical, and Romantic music at a level that rivaled established European orchestras.
    
2. **Opera Houses**: Opera houses were set up in these cities to bring European Romantic opera to America. This move allowed American musicians and singers to enter the world-class arena and eventually compete with, and even surpass, their European counterparts.
    
3. **European Conductors and Repertoire**: Often, European conductors were hired to lead these orchestras, focusing on standard European Classical and Romantic works. This era predated the existence of recording and radio technology.
    
4. **American Music in the 20th Century**: American composers in the early 20th century drew from the country's rich folk music and hymns. They began to experiment with European artistic trends like impressionism, expressionism, and modernism, infusing these styles with American themes and ideals.
    
5. **Minimalism and Aleatoric Music**: The text identifies Minimalism and Indeterminacy (chance) music as new American Classical genres. Minimalism is described as an avant-garde form of music employing repetitive patterns and limited musical materials. Aleatoric or chance music incorporates random elements into composition, adding unpredictability to the performance.
