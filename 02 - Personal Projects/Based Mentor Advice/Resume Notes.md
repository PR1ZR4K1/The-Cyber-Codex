# Resume Notes

- Use Canva
- Uniform formatting
- No address, may put US Citizen instead
- phone number and email are okay
- don't make name disproportionate to pages
- quantify experience (put numbers, percentages, etc)
- add dates for experience and projects (make sure they are all formatted similarly)
- 0.5" inch margins
- try to fill in as much white space as possible
- keep track of work or projects that you do so that you don't forget to include it in your resume (this is like advice for the future)
