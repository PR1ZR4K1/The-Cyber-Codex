# Budget Analysis Project ðŸ“Š

## Project Overview
Your manager has requested a comprehensive budget analysis report based on the provided financial data.

## Data Sources

- ![[Pasted image 20241027215124.png]]: Monthly expense data (Jan-Sep)
- Annual budget information
- Fixed costs:
  - Monthly rent: $3,126
  - Insurance: 
    - $195/month (Jan-Apr)
    - $225/month (May onwards)

## Required Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Organization
- [ ] Create comprehensive table from Attachment 1
- [ ] Include all expense categories:
  - Salaries
  - Supplies
  - Phone
  - Utilities
  - Travel
  - Training
  - Advertising
  - Rent
  - Insurance

### 2. Calculations Required

#### Basic Calculations
- [ ] Utilize cell arithmetic for all computations
- [ ] Calculate row totals (monthly totals)
- [ ] Calculate column totals (category totals)

#### Advanced Metrics
1. Average Actual Expenses:
   $$\text{Average}_{\text{category}} = \frac{\sum \text{Actual Expenses}_{\text{category}}}{\text{Number of Months}}$$

2. Estimate to Complete (ETC):
   $$\text{ETC} = \text{Monthly Average} \times \text{Remaining Months}$$
   > Note: Exclude rent and insurance from this calculation as they are fixed costs

3. Estimate at Completion (EAC):
   $$\text{EAC} = \text{Actual Costs} + \text{ETC}$$

4. Budget Variance Analysis:
   $$\text{Variance} = \text{Annual Budget} - \text{EAC}$$

### 3. Visualization Requirements
- [ ] Create column chart titled "Difference Comparison"
- [ ] Include two data series:
  1. Budget amounts
  2. EAC amounts
- [ ] Add data labels under each category
- [ ] Ensure clear visual representation of variances

### 4. Report Structure

#### A. Introduction
- Explain analysis context
- State objective
- Outline scope

#### B. Methodology
- Detail calculation methods
- Explain assumptions
- Document process steps

#### C. Findings
- Present calculation table
- Highlight significant variances
  $$\text{Significance} = \frac{|\text{Budget} - \text{EAC}|}{\text{Budget}} \times 100\%$$
- Provide narrative analysis

#### D. Recommendations
- [ ] Develop action items for budget compliance
- [ ] Prioritize interventions
- [ ] Suggest monitoring mechanisms

## Key Formulas Reference

### Monthly Average
```
Monthly_Average = SUM(Jan:Sep)/9
```

### ETC Calculation
```
ETC = Monthly_Average * (12 - current_month)
```

### EAC Calculation
```
EAC = YTD_Actual + ETC
```

### Variance Analysis
```
Budget_Variance = Annual_Budget - EAC
```
