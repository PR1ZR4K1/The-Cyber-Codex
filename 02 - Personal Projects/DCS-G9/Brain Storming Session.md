# Brain Storming Session

sceneOne: add button in the actions pane to be able to go back to the events pane. add events to events pane that are basically updates instead of events that can be responded to

initialization: add button that user can use to navigate to next scene that isn't the top bar.

Game Time: Need a way to have different actions increment the game time a certain way. 

Clock Time: will have a function run using setInterval to make certain events appear after a certain amount of real time relative to the game time has elapsed.

Timeline: we will have fixed attacks that will occur throughout the game and then artificial events that the user will respond to and their actions will place new events on the timeline.

Perk Matrix: in G9 Game scenes_focused_timeline development

just use real perks in asset mgmt and make up the rest of the perks
