# Portfolio Website Kick Start

**The following is a list of resources that I feel will be useful to aid you as you embark on an extraordinary web development journey ;)**

## Resources

### 1. Design Resources

- **Wireframing Tools** (Web page design shit)
    - v0 (free make an account. By Vercel)
	    - v0.dev
	    - AI chatbot that will create a page design based on your prompt.
    - Figma (Free tier)
	    - figma.com
	    - Little more involved prolly unnecessary
- **Color Palette Generators**
	- https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors
    - Coolors.co
    - htmlcolorcodes.com
    - https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp
- **Typography**
    - Google Fonts
	    - fonts.google.com
	    - Don't go too crazy you want your website to be professionalish

### 2. Technical Resources

#### AI

**For the love of god use ChatGPT, Claude, or whatever tf idc. It WILLL help you develop and explain shit better than I ever could. I'm so nice I will even give you the links :)**

- **ChatGPT**
	- https://chatgpt.com/
	- Buy 4o if you can it is definitely worth it.
- **Claude**
	- https://claude.ai/
	- I've been using this over chatgpt recently and I like it, but it doesn't include the crazy amount of specialized models that chatgpt comes with.

#### HTML/CSS Fundamentals

- **Tailwindcss**
	- https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first
	- READ THE DOCS ^^^
	- Detailed explanation of all the base classes tailwind has to offer and how to extend/customize them
- **HTML Best Practices**
	- https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzYMFd-lQL4
	- Not necessary but always here for reference :)
- **Typescript**
	- https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html
	- Official site to get people started. Literally the first time I've seen it but after a brief read seems useful to have. Probably not necessary for our tasks, but if you want to do shit right I would check it out just don't overwhelm yourself n you're good :)
	- https://youtu.be/ahCwqrYpIuM?si=X0IoA9BkOqCnEk8a&t=314
	- Review of the concepts I covered in the lab. 

#### UI Libraries

**Generally try to stick to one or two. (There are so many options available, but here are my top three).**

- **Nextui**
	- https://nextui.org/docs/guide/introduction
	- Again read the documentation it is very important. It's usually very concise but if not have ChatGPT summarize lol.
	- Not endorsed or created by Vercel (people who made nextjs) weird, but their stuff is good imo.
- **Material Tailwind**
	- https://www.material-tailwind.com/
	- This does come from the people who made Tailwind so huge dubs.
- **Shadcn**
	- https://ui.shadcn.com/docs
	- Actually not a ui library lol. You essentially grab these barebones components with minimal styling and make them your own. A little more involved than the ones above, but you have a lot more control over the functionality and design aspects which is nice sometimes.

#### Version Control

- Git basics
- GitHub Pages for hosting

### 4. Asset Resources

#### Image Editing

- Gimp
	- I literally use gimp for everything. Usually you only need to do things like make backgrounds transparent.

#### Icon Libraries

**Most of these are an npm install and then you import the icon into the project to use it :)**

- **Flat Icon**
	- https://www.flaticon.com/
	- Literally the fucking best site for downloading nice colored icons (You put them into the public folder maybe make subfolders so it is more organized. and then you use the <Image /> tag to render them)
- **Heroicons**
	- https://heroicons.com/
	- Nice for simple bordered icons. I use it all the time
- **React Icons**
	- https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/
	- If hero icons doesn't have it I go here


### 5. Website Inspiration

**I literally searched "Professional portfolio website Nextjs" and adapted different concepts from different videos into my own project. I advise you do the same :0**

- **MINEEEE**
	- https://portfolio-lilac-phi-95.vercel.app/
	- Yea it's the shit don't copy it, but by all means use it for reference. I will make my repo available for you mfs <3 just hmu and give me your github username or email.
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0-L_M3Ad4
	- Here's the video I used. Yea there are a lot of similarities, but I definitely made it my own which is what matters :). 
- **Youtube**

	*In no particular order. Keep in mind the time of upload for these tutorials because next continuously gets updated. If you run into an issue with versioning it will be a pain in the ass, but remember someone else has definitely ran into your issue before so just do some research.*

	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTH6Dn3AyIQ
		- Badass site full tutorial with deployment details
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hps-XPN1GeE
		- Super nice design and clean animations imo
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kb1f5bvF6f4
		- Voice kinda pisses me off, but site looks cool and seems pretty simple
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfC1u8eNKsY
		- Simple example using ShadCN
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUKptmUVIBM
		- This guy actually makes really good videos on React, Nextjs, and webdev content in general.
