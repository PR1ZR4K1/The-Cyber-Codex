# Teacher Assistant Web Interface

This web server would allow for various TA's from IST classes make requests to Cyberlab Admins to start deployments. There will be two different dashboards one for the Administrators and another for the TA's.

## Purpose

Streamline deployments by allowing TA's to make requests detailing what they need for their class.
