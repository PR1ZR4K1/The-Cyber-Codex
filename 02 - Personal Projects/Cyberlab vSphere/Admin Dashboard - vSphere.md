# Admin Dashboard - vSphere

The administrator dashboard would display every ticket that has been posted. There will be an additional screen you can navigate to once you click on a specific ticket. A global variable will handle whether or not a deployment is currently in progress or not. This will determine whether or not certain options will be available or not.

## Ticket Info

Tickets have information on when it was created, for what professor, how long it has been in queue for, if it has been started or not, by which TA.
