# The Foundations of Artificial Intelligence

The notion of **tractability** has had an even greater impact on AI. Roughly speaking, a problem is called intractable if the time required to solve instances of the problem grows exponentially with the size of the instances.

The theory of **NP-Completeness** provides a basis for analyzing the tractability of problems: any problem class to which the class of NP-complete problems are necessarily intractable.

Futurists make much of these numbers, pointing to an approaching **singularity** at which computers reach a superhuman level of performance

Even with a super computer with unlimited capacity we still require further conceptual breakthroughs in our understanding of intelligence.

Doug Engelbart, one of the pioneers of HCI, championed the idea of **intelligence augmentation** IA rather than AI. 
Today we are more likely to see IA and AI as two sides of the same coin, with the former emphasizing human control and the latter emphasizing intelligent behavior on the part of the machine.

### Physical Symbol System (1976)

A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action. (human or machine) exhibiting intelligence must operate by manipulating data structures composed of symbols. *This has been challenged from many directions*

## Neats vs. Scruffies

"The brittleness of expert systems let to a new more scientific approach incorporating probability rather than Boolean logic, machine learning rather than hand-coding"

### Neats

- Those who think that AI theories should be grounded in mathematical rigor

### Scruffies

- Those who would rather try out lots of ideas, write some programs, and then assess what seems to be working.
- present emphasis on deep learning may represent a resurgence of the scruffies.

## Deep Learning

Refers to machine learning using multiple layers of simple, adjustable computing elements. 

*Not until 2011 did deep learning methods really take off*
Due to big data.

- Relies heavily on powerful hardware
- Depends on the availability of large amounts of training data
