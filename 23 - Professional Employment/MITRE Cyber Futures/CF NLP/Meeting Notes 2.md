# Meeting Notes 2

## Questions

- How to accept data from end user
	- Proposed solution: custom web server that can connect with elastic
- What form should we expect data to come in? 
	- Formatted excel
	- Formatted JSON
	- Other
	- Audio
	- Who creates the format?
- What other visualization tools should we use for our dashboard?
- How is the deployment expected to go long term?
	- Should I put strides into making deployment as seamless as possible
	- I'm thinking I can make the setup be facilitated through docker compose and have everything spin up automatically. This makes the most sense if we want the tool to be used on a case by case basis or if it would be something that is hosted in one location.
