## Personal Questions

- Is June 10th the hard start date since it says "proposed" in the offer letter?
- Confirm duration of internship is 10 weeks
	*Must be longer than 8 weeks in order to avoid repaying Intern Relocation Benefit*
- Is clearance required for this position?
- Can I do the Artificial Intelligence track?

	Best bet is to reach out to Lauren for the track that I could get onto
