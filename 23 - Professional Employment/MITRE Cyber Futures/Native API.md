# Native API

**Overview**:

The Native API is a set of low-level functions in the Windows operating system that are used by the kernel and core system components. It provides a way for system-level software and drivers to interact directly with the Windows kernel (ntoskrnl.exe) and other system services.

**Characteristics**:

1. **Low-Level Access**: The Native API offers direct interaction with the Windows kernel, allowing for low-level system operations that are not exposed through the higher-level Windows API.
   
2. **Undocumented**: The Native API is not officially documented by Microsoft for public use, primarily intended for internal use by the operating system. However, some information has been reverse-engineered and documented by third-party sources.

**Core Libraries**:

1. **Ntdll.dll**: The main library that exposes the Native API functions. User-mode applications can access the Native API through this dynamic link library.
   
2. **Nt.dll**: This is the internal library used by kernel-mode components.

**Key Functions**:

1. **Process and Thread Management**:
    - **NtCreateProcess**: Creates a new process.
    - **NtCreateThread**: Creates a new thread within a process.
   
2. **Memory Management**:
    - **NtAllocateVirtualMemory**: Allocates virtual memory in the address space of a process.
    - **NtFreeVirtualMemory**: Releases previously allocated virtual memory.
   
3. **File and Device I/O**:
    - **NtCreateFile**: Creates or opens a file or device.
    - **NtReadFile**: Reads data from a file or device.
    - **NtWriteFile**: Writes data to a file or device.
   
4. **Object Management**:
    - **NtCreateEvent**: Creates or opens an event object.
    - **NtOpenKey**: Opens a registry key.

**Usage**:

- **System Components**: Core Windows components, such as the Windows subsystem (csrss.exe) and the session manager (smss.exe), rely on the Native API for essential operations.
  
- **Drivers**: Device drivers use the Native API to perform tasks that require direct kernel access.
  
- **Advanced Applications**: Some advanced applications and tools may use the Native API to perform specialized tasks that require low-level system access.

**Risks and Considerations**:

1. **Compatibility**: Because the Native API is not officially documented, it may change between Windows versions, leading to compatibility issues.
   
2. **Stability**: Direct interaction with the kernel using the Native API can potentially compromise system stability and security if not used correctly.

### Explanation

The Native API provides critical low-level functions that underpin the operation of the Windows operating system. It allows for operations that are not available through the higher-level Windows API, enabling system components and drivers to interact directly with the kernel.

### LaTeX Expression

An example of a system call using the Native API can be represented as:

``` c++
NTSTATUS status = NtCreateFile(&hFile, GENERIC_READ, &objAttributes, &ioStatus, NULL, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, FILE_SHARE_READ, FILE_OPEN, FILE_SYNCHRONOUS_IO_NONALERT, NULL, 0);
```


#### Key Components

Understanding the Native API is essential for developing system-level software and drivers that require direct interaction with the Windows kernel, enabling advanced functionality and performance optimizations.
