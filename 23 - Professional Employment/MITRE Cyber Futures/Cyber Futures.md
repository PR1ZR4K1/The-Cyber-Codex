# Internship Description

The [Cyber Futures](https://www.mitre.org/news-insights/student-voice/mitre-program-inspires-new-generation-cyber-professionals) student groups complete a 10-week experiential, competitively paid internship. In the months following the conclusion of the inaugural program, half of those interns returned to MITRE to pursue additional projects.

The students come from a range of technology majors—including computer engineering, software engineering, and cybersecurity. However, the curricula vary from one institution to another. That’s why the Cyber Futures experience offers a clear understanding of how classroom lessons apply when you’re faced with actual cyber challenges.
