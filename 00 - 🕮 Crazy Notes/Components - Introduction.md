# Components

Components serve as the building blocks for React applications, allowing developers to break down complex UIs into smaller, manageable parts. Each component is responsible for rendering a part of the user interface and may have its own state, props, and life cycle methods.

## Types of Components

Components can be either class-based or functional.

- Class-based components make use of ES6 classes and have a `render` method that defines what the UI looks like. 

- Functional components are simpler and just consist of a function that returns JSX (JavaScript XML syntax for defining UI elements).
