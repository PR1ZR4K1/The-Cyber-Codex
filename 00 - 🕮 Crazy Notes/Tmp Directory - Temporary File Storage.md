# Tmp Directory - Temporary File Storage

The `/tmp` directory serves as a temporary storage area where programs can store temporary files. These files are generally deleted upon system reboot, ensuring that the directory doesn't become cluttered with outdated data. It is a common space where applications can create files for temporary use, facilitating data exchange and temporary storage.
