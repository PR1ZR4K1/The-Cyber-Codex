# React

React is an open-source JavaScript library widely used for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications (SPAs) where you can interact with the page and see content updates without refreshing. Developed and maintained by Facebook, React allows developers to build web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.

### Advantages:

- **Declarative**: React allows developers to describe UIs declaratively, meaning developers specify what they want to achieve, and React takes care of the implementation details.
    
- **Re-usability**: Components are reusable, leading to better maintainability, consistency, and development efficiency.
    
- **Performance**: Virtual DOM and smart diffing algorithm optimize rendering and provide high performance for high-traffic applications.
    
- **Community & Ecosystem**: React has a vast and active community of developers, extensive libraries, tools, and a wealth of tutorials, making it a good choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

### Core Concepts:

- **[[Components - Functional]]**
	
- **[[JSX]]**
	
- **[[Virtual DOM]]**
    
- **[[State & Props]]**
    
- **[[Hooks]]**
