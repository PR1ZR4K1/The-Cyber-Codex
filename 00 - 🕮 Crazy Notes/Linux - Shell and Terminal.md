# Linux - Shell and Terminal

The Linux Shell is a powerful interface that facilitates communication between the user and the Linux kernel, the core of the operating system. Through the shell, users can issue commands, manipulate files, and execute programs. It interprets user commands and scripts, translating them into instructions that the kernel can understand and execute.

A Linux Terminal is what allows a user to interact with the shell.
