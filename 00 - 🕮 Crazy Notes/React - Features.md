# React - Features

Here are some basic features to consider:

-  **[[JSX]]**
- **[[Components - Introduction]]**

- Fundamental building blocks in a React application.
- Can be functional or class components.

### Props

- Props (short for "properties") allow you to pass data from parent components down to child components.

### State

- React components have internal state, allowing them to re-render when data changes.

### Lifecycle Methods

- In class components, lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` let you run side-effects.

### Hooks

- Functional components can use hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` to handle state and lifecycle features.

### Virtual DOM

- React maintains a Virtual DOM and updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM, leading to faster and more efficient updates.

### Event Handling

- React has a synthetic event system that wraps around native browser events, providing a consistent API.

### Conditional Rendering

- React offers several ways to conditionally render components, using ternary operators, logical "AND" (`&&`), or methods like `map` for array rendering.

### Controlled Components

- In React, form elements like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` typically maintain their own state, but React can control them via state and functions.

### Higher-Order Components (HOCs)

- Functions that take a component and return a new component with additional properties or behaviors.

### Context API

- Provides a way to pass data down through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.

### React Router

- Though not a part of React core, React Router is often used for routing in single-page applications built with React.

### Immutability

- Important for the efficient updating of components, React emphasizes the use of immutable data structures.

### Fragments

- Allows you to return multiple elements from a component without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

### Lazy Loading and Code Splitting

- You can use `React.lazy()` for component-level code-splitting and lazy loading.
